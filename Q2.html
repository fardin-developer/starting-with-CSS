                In CSS, A class naming convention in CSS is a set of guidelines used to create consistent and meaningful names for CSS classes applied to HTML elements.

            <p class="para-italic">
                By using a class naming convention, developers can easily understand the purpose and context of each CSS class, making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase. Different conventions exist, and each has its own unique approach to naming classes.

                    <li class="list"><span>Maintainability and Refactoring- Consistent and meaningful class facilitate code maintenance and refactoring.</span></li>
                    <li class="list"><span> Code Reusability -  A well-written class name is more likely to be reusable in different parts of the application or a project</span></li>
                    <br>
                    <li class="list"><span>Collaboration and Teamwork - In a collaborative programming or project environment multiple developers may work on the same project. Meaningful class names provide a common vocabulary to team members,
